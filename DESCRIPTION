Description: This package presents the gamma, Weibull, lognormal and log-logistic models for component lifetime distribution from superposed renewal processes by means of latent variables. Two approaches are available: the maximization of the likelihood function through EM algorithm and the Bayesian paradigm by obtaining MCMC samples from the posterior distribution.
